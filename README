This is a gradle library that works together with an android library to help team work in doing json reports for Unit and instrumented tests for continuos integration and continuos development.
The other library is a jitpack library:
- we should add the dependency in app build gradle:     implementation 'com.github.giuseppegargani:JsonReport:0.0.1'
- and (eventually) add the maven repository to jitpack in settings.gradle:          maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    in settings.gradle file:
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
            mavenLocal()
            jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
